  <section id="who-i-am">
      <p>I'm an electronics technician graduated in 2019 at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (<a href="https://www.ifsc.edu.br/international">IFSC</a>), 
        who now strives to get an undergraduate degree in Electronical Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina
        (<a href="https://en.ufsc.br/">UFSC</a>). Currently, I live in Florian√≥polis, Brazil, where, in addition to studying engineering, I study 
        programming on my own. When I'm not designing new circuits, studying or coding, I like to play some basketball or 
        soccer, to read and to sing -- sometimes mixing things up too...</p>
